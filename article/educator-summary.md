# Educator Summary: "When the Documentation Dies"

## Case Study Overview

This case study examines how memecoin launchpads with creator royalties are emerging as an alternative funding mechanism for open source software with a focus on AI development. Set in January 2026, it opens with two catalyzing events—Tailwind Labs laying off 75% of its engineering team after AI destroyed its documentation-based revenue model, and prominent maintainer Anthony Fu's public reflection on open source burnout—before exploring how four creator-led projects generated over $600,000 in two weeks through speculative token trading.

## Topics & Frameworks Covered

| Topic | Framework/Concept | Application in Case |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Platform economics | Two-sided markets, Network effects | Bags.fm's creator-trader flywheel; cross-side subsidization |
| Business model innovation | Business Model Canvas | Platform value propositions, revenue streams, key resources |
| Customer insight | Jobs to Be Done (JTBD) | Creator funding needs vs. traditional mechanisms; trader motivations |
| Competitive strategy | Platform envelope theory | How royalties create switching costs and defensibility |
| Market structure | Zero-sum vs. positive-sum games | Whether speculation can fund public goods |
| Innovation financing | Disruptive funding models | Comparison to grants, sponsorship, VC |
| Technology disruption | AI impact on business models | Tailwind's documentation traffic collapse |
| Sustainability | OSS maintainer economics | Burnout, funding gaps, incentive alignment |

## Suggested Use Cases

**MBA/Business Strategy**: Platform economics, two-sided market dynamics, network effects analysis, business model innovation

**Entrepreneurship**: Alternative funding mechanisms, creator economy, community-driven monetization

**Technology Management**: Open source sustainability, AI disruption of business models, developer tools ecosystem

**Ethics & Policy**: Zero-sum dynamics in speculative markets, regulatory considerations, "involuntary donation" as funding mechanism

**Finance**: Tokenomics, speculation vs. investment, market structure analysis

## Discussion Questions Included

The case includes 8 discussion questions covering platform defense strategy, sustainability metrics, incentive corruption, regulatory scenarios, Porter's Five Forces application, the ethics of speculation-funded public goods, and scaling limits of the model.

## Data & Sources

All metrics are sourced from live APIs (DexScreener, Bags.fm) with automated updates. The case includes verifiable data on four projects ($GAS, $RALPH, $GSD, $LEON) and references to creator social media, GitHub repositories, and project documentation. A live dashboard at vibefunded.xyz provides real-time tracking.
