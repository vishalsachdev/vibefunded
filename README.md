## About

VibeFunded visualizes a new funding model for open source software: memecoins with built-in royalty mechanisms. Instead of relying on grants, donations, or venture capital, OSS creators or community members can launch tokens where trading volume directly funds ongoing development.

This dashboard tracks real-time metrics for OSS projects that have launched memecoins on Bags.fm, showing:

- **Total earnings** from trading royalties
- **Market metrics** (price, volume, liquidity)
- **Price changes** across multiple timeframes
- **Project information** and links to creator socials

## The Model

**How it works:**
1. OSS creators or community members launch memecoins on Bags.fm for OSS projects
2. Each trade generates royalties that go to support the project
3. Trading volume directly translates to project funding
4. Network effects drive sustainable, perpetual revenue

**Why it matters:**
- **Disrupts traditional funding** - No grant applications or VC pitches
- **Community-driven** - Funding scales with project popularity
- **Risk-free for creators** - Royalties provide ongoing maintenance funding
- **Transparent** - All earnings are visible on-chain
