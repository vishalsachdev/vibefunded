### Project Specifications: Interactive Realtime Memecoin Dashboard for Bags.fm Creator-Focused OSS Funding Case Study

**Project Title**: Bags.fm OSS Creator Memecoin Dashboard  
**Purpose**: A supporting artifact for the business school case study on disruptive funding models in open source software (OSS) and AI development via Bags.fm's creator royalty memecoins. The dashboard visualizes realtime market performance of "vibe-coded" OSS/AI-related memecoins as a proxy for royalty-generated funding streams, demonstrating network effects, sustained creator incentives, and disruption vs. traditional grants/VC models. It highlights how trading volume translates to direct, perpetual creator revenue.

**Target User**: Business school students, researchers, or analysts studying platform strategy, network effects, and innovation in crypto/creator economies.  
**Deployment Target**: Replit (use Replit's Agent to build and host). The app should be a public web app with auto-refresh for realtime data.

**Tech Stack (Recommended for Replit Agent)**:
- **Framework**: Streamlit (Python) – ideal for rapid, interactive dashboards with minimal code. It's Replit-friendly, supports caching, auto-refresh, and Plotly/Altair charts.
- **Language**: Python 3.10+
- **Key Libraries**:
  - `streamlit`
  - `requests` (for API calls)
  - `pandas` (data handling/tables)
  - `plotly` or `altair` (interactive charts)
  - `time` and `streamlit.autorefresh` (for realtime updates)
- No backend database needed (all data fetched live from public APIs).
- No authentication required (public dashboard).

**Data Sources (All Public, No API Keys Needed)**:
- Primary: DexScreener public API (unofficial but reliable and widely used in crypto dashboards):
  - Search endpoint: `https://api.dexscreener.com/latest/dex/search?q={query}` (query = ticker symbol, e.g., "GAS" or "RALPH")
  - Pair details: `https://api.dexscreener.com/latest/dex/pairs/solana/{pair_address}`
- Logic for token resolution:
  - For each predefined ticker, query the search endpoint.
  - Filter results to chainId == "solana" and preferably dexId == "raydium" (common for Bags.fm graduates).
  - Select the pair with highest 24h volume or liquidity as the "main" pair.
  - Cache results for 30–60 seconds to avoid rate limits.
- Fallback: If no results or API down, display "Data unavailable" with manual refresh button.
- Key metrics to extract/parse:
  - Price (USD)
  - Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) or Market Cap
  - 24h Volume (USD)
  - Liquidity (USD)
  - Price changes: 5m, 1h, 6h, 24h (%)
  - Pair age (if available)
  - DexScreener pair URL (for hyperlink)

**Predefined Token List** (Hardcode this as a Python list/dict; focus on vibe-coded OSS/AI creator funding tokens from the case study):
Use this exact list – these are community/creator-endorsed Bags.fm launches that direct royalties to OSS maintainers or AI experimenters.

| Ticker     | Project Name                  | Creator / Maintainer                  | Description (Display in Dashboard)                                                                 |

| $TEXTUAL  | Textual                      | Will McGugan (@willmcgugan)          | Python TUI framework; royalties support long-term maintenance of widely used OSS library.         |
| $SOLPRIV  | solprivacy                   | Tetsuo Corp                          | AI-powered wallet privacy scanner; funds on-chain privacy tooling.                                 |
| $FACTORY  | Factory                      | Bags ecosystem AI builders           | Natural language to app prototyping platform; royalties accelerate full-stack AI builds.          |
| $OSS      | Meta OSS Funding             | Community                            | Generic token directing royalties to open-source maintainers; meta-play on sustainable funding.   |

- Optional: Add a user input field to search/add arbitrary tickers (for extensibility).

**UI Layout & Features**:
1. **Header Section**:
   - Title: "Bags.fm Creator Memecoin Dashboard: Realtime OSS Funding via Royalties"
   - Subtitle: Brief case study context (2–3 sentences): "Visualizing how Bags.fm's royalty model turns speculative trading into sustainable funding for vibe-coded open source and AI projects (as of Jan 2026)."
   - Auto-refresh indicator: "Data refreshes every 60 seconds" + countdown timer.
   - Manual refresh button.

2. **Summary Cards (Top Row, 4–6 KPI cards)**:
   - Total Market Cap (sum of listed tokens)
   - Total 24h Volume (proxy for total royalty generation)
   - Number of Active Tokens (with volume > $1k)
   - Average 24h Price Change
   - Highest Volume Token

3. **Interactive Table (Main Section)**:
   - Pandas DataFrame displayed via `st.dataframe` or `st.table` with sorting enabled.
   - Columns: Ticker (hyperlink to DexScreener), Project Name, Creator, Price (USD), FDV/MC, 24h Volume, Liquidity, 5m/1h/6h/24h Change (color-coded green/red), Pair Age.
   - Row selection: Multi-select checkbox column for comparison charts.

4. **Charts Section (Below Table)**:
   - Bar chart: 24h Volume comparison (selected or all tokens) – horizontal bars, sorted descending.
   - Pie chart: Volume distribution (% share across listed tokens).
   - Optional gauge charts for individual token health (e.g., 24h change).

5. **Sidebar**:
   - Filter: "Show only tokens with 24h volume > $X"
   - Auto-refresh interval selector (30s / 60s / manual)
   - "Add custom ticker" text input + button (fetches and adds temporarily)
   - Case study notes section (static text summarizing key insights from the case).

**Realtime Behavior**:
- Use `streamlit-autorefresh` library (or manual `st.rerun` in a loop) to refresh data every 60 seconds.
- Cache API responses with `@st.cache_data(ttl=60)` to reduce load.
- Handle errors gracefully (e.g., "API rate limit – retrying in 30s").

**Additional Requirements**:
- Mobile-responsive (Streamlit default).
- Dark mode support (Streamlit theme).
- Footer: "Data from DexScreener API • Built for Bags.fm OSS Funding Case Study • Jan 2026 • DYOR – crypto is volatile".
- Error handling: If a token has no Solana pair, mark as "Inactive/No Data".
- Performance: Limit to 10–15 tokens max to avoid API spam.

**Code Structure Outline (for Replit Agent)**:
```python
import streamlit as st
import requests
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
from streamlit_autorefresh import st_autorefresh

# Hardcoded token list (dict of ticker: metadata)

# Function: fetch_dexscreener_data(ticker)

# Main app logic: refresh, fetch all, build DF, display summary/cards/table/charts
```

**Handoff Instructions for Replit Agent**:
"Build a Streamlit dashboard exactly per these specs. Prioritize clean UI, realtime refresh, and accurate DexScreener integration. Make it deployable as a public Replit web app. Test with the predefined token list – ensure Solana pairs are correctly selected."

This spec is complete and self-contained – the Replit Agent should be able to generate a fully functional prototype in one shot. Let me know if you want tweaks before handing it off!
